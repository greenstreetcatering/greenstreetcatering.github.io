                        <p>Part of the national <a href="http://thefamilydinnerproject.org/" target="_blank">Family Dinner Project</a>, a group of school teachers and administrators from Mabel Elementary school organized and hosted a community family dinner (hopefully the first of many to come). On November 14, 2014, Mabel Elementary School hosted their fist community family dinner. Green Street Catering served 110 people with a large buffet. Participants came together to enjoy community fellowship and were encouraged to have regular family meals together at home.
